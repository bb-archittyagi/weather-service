= Weather Service (Vert.x)
:toc:
:toclevels: 2

A reactive backend weather service built using *Java* and *Vert.x*, designed to fetch real-time weather data from an external API, process it asynchronously, and store it in a *MySQL* database.  
The application exposes RESTful APIs and follows a clean, layered architecture suitable for scalable microservices.

== ✨ Features
* Non-blocking, reactive architecture using Vert.x
* RESTful APIs for weather data access
* External weather API integration
* Persistent storage using MySQL
* Clean separation of Router, Service, DAO, and Config layers
* Gradle-based build system

== 🛠 Tech Stack
* Java 11
* Vert.x 4.x
* MySQL
* Gradle
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript (basic frontend)

== 🚀 Running the Application

=== Prerequisites
* Java 11+
* MySQL running locally
* Gradle (wrapper included)

=== Build & Run
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew clean run
----

=== Run Tests
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew clean test

== 🧪 API Endpoints (Example)
* `GET /health` – Service health check
* `GET /weather` – Fetch stored weather data
* `POST /weather` – Fetch and store weather data from external API

== 📌 Learning Outcomes
* Hands-on experience with reactive programming
* Understanding of non-blocking I/O in backend services
* REST API design using Vert.x Web
* Database interaction using async SQL clients

== 🔮 Future Enhancements
* Authentication & authorization
* Caching using Redis
* Dockerization
* Deployment on cloud platforms (AWS / GCP)
